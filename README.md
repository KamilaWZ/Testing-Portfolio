# Portfolio
This repository includes my non-commercial testing projects and information about my testing skills.

# About me
I'm Kamila, a true quality assurance and software testing enthusiast. As I am familiar with the basics of Python, I started testing web applications, which resulted in non-commercial testing projects. My goal is to develop my testing and technical skills as well as gain knowledge about automated testing. Please find below documentation that I am working on both in Polish and English. Feel free to visit this repository regularly, as my latest projects can be found here! ðŸ™‚ 

# My current projects

Here, you can find my documentation for testing web applications located at https://iprzedszkole.progman.pl/. The app is an electronic system for kindergartens with a module for parents. I collected a plan of my tests, test scenarios, test cases, bug reports, and a report of my tests, as below:
