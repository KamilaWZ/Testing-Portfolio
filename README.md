# Portfolio
This repository includes my non-commercial testing projects and information about my testing skills.

# About me
I'm Kamila, a true software testing enthusiast. As I am familiar with the basics of Python, I started testing web applications, which resulted in non-commercial testing projects. My goal is to develop my testing and technical skills as well as gain knowledge about automated testing. Please find below documentation that I am working on both in Polish and English. Feel free to visit this repository regularly, as my latest projects can be found here! ðŸ™‚ 

# My projects - testing documentation
